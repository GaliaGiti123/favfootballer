Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time, Messi has a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards, four of which he won consecutively, and a record-tying four European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won 29 trophies, including eight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga">La Liga</a>  titles, four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League">UEFA Champions League</a>  titles, and five Copas del Rey.

His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>  who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. </p>

	<p>Messi raised in central Argentina. He was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d%27Or"> Ballon d'Or </a>and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Copa_Am%C3%A9rica">2007 Copa América,</a>  where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup">2014 World Cup</a> for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup">2018 World Cup.</a> </p>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario. He is the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Biancucchi">Maximiliano</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Biancucchi">Emanuel Biancucchi</a>, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.
	Messi was a diehearted supporter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell%27s_Old_Boys">Newell's Old Boys</a>. Later, he joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. In that time,  he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87".

	Messi's parents sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. In February 2001, Messi relocated to Bercelona with his family. They moved into an apartment near Barcelona club stedium, Camp Nue.  During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's. In February 2002, after a year at Barcelona's youth academy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia">La Masia</a> Messi was finally enrolled in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> (RFEF). Gradually, he became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.">Arsenal</a> but he wanted to stay in Barcelona.</p>
	<h2>International Career</h2>
	<p> On 29 June 2004, Lionel Messi debuted for national team against Paraguay. Messi scored total 77 goals for Argentina National Team and currently he is the captain of this team.<br>At first, Messi was offered to play in Spain national team. But he wanted to play for his country <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team">Argentina</a> . So he declined that offer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Football_Association">Argentine Football Association</a> organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA">FIFA</a>. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory.
	In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_P%C3%A9kerman">José Pékerman</a>  gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina. Then, Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team"> United States</a> in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia_national_football_team">Colombia</a> . As they had secured their place in the knockout phase, Messi started the next game on the bench, coming on in the last 25 minutes with the score at 0–0 to help his team defeat Paraguay by assisting their only goal. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[268] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team">Brazil</a> squad which lacked several of the nation's best players. Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rom%C3%A1n_Riquelme">Juan Román Riquelme</a> . He was named the best young player of the tournament by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL</a> .</p>
	<h2>Club Career</h2>
	<p>Leo Messi has played 600 matches with FC Barcelona, scoring 523 goals, and has won 30 titles.<br>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona_Juvenil_A">Juveniles A</a> , where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French Winger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovic_Giuly">Ludovic Giuly </a> explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rijkaard">Frank Rijkaard</a> 's first team.<br>On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Gamper_Trophy">Joan Gamper Trophy</a> , Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Capello">Fabio Capello</a> 's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.">Juventus</a>, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who were willing to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Laporta"> Joan Laporta</a>, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014. Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records.</p>

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>Since 2008, when he was 20, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his best friend since childhood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Scaglia">Lucas Scaglia</a>, who is also a football player. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding. Messi and Roccuzzo have two sons: Thiago (born 2012) and Mateo (born 2015).On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a> post.<br>

		</figure>
		<br>Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe">Rosario</a> .

	Since leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent.</p>
	<h2>Charity</h2>
	<p>Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassadors">UNICEF goodwill ambassador</a> since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">recent earthquake</a>. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.

In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>, and elsewhere in the world</p>
